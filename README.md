# Architun
Architun *(arr·chi·toon)* is a comic book-style font brought to you by Sayhone. *(Or Sayhone721.)*
This font was based on an image that I saw on GitHub and then I vectorized it with FontForge. *(Also if you’re wondering, I didn’t auto trace the image.)* There’s currently only one weight *(Medium)* and 931 glyphs, but there will be more weights and more glyphs in the future.
