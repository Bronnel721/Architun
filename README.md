Architun is a comic book-style font brought to you by Sayhone. *(Or Sayhone721.)*
# Origin
This font was based on an image that I saw on GitHub and then I vectorized it with FontForge. *(Also if you’re wondering, I didn’t auto trace the image.)*

# Weights & Styles
There’s currently only one weight, and that weight is Medium, but there will be more weights in the future.
# Glyphs
There’s currently 931 glyphs in the font, but just like the weights, there will be more in the future.
# License
The license for this font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. So you can modify it, as long as they are not sold by themselves.
